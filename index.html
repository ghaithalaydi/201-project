    <h1>Ghaith AL-Aydi</h1>
    <p>A professional consultant with 3+ years of experience in the field; previously based in
        Riyadh - Saudi Arabia. With primary interest in a career path in strategy and operations
        management including areas such as strategy planning and formulation, strategy development,
        strategy execution, data mining, clustering, manipulating/ filtering modeling. Previously
        employed as a strategy consultant in the strategy execution department at the Palladium Group,
        with core focus on areas related to strategy execution. I believe that my academic background
        alongside my consulting experience properly qualifies me to be a suitable candidate for a
        position related to strategy implementation roles.</p>
